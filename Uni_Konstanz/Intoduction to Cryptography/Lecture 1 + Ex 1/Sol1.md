# Excercise 2

shift cipher:

A single character of chosen plaintext is sufficeient. From resulting plaintext-ciphertext pair (m,c) âˆˆ M x C the key is easy to calculate since k = c - m mod 26

Mono-alphabetic substitution:

We need 26 characters (a...z) of chosen plaintext. From resulting cipher-text we get a key(all substitutions).

Vigenere:

We just need to take character "a" t times, to recover the key

# Exercise 3

abcd or begd

(a) We can definetely determine the passwords, because if we use shift-cipher we will see that ciphertext have letters that goes consistently or not.

(b) if key length 2

we need to split our cipher text by ab cd or be dg. Then we will see from ciphertext if "a" and "c" were encrypted or "b" and "d"

    if key length 3

same idea but split to abc d and bed g.

    if key length 4

we can get any information about password, by using same method
