Π = (Gen, Mac, Vrfy)

Canonical verification:

1. computes t' := Mac_k(m)
2. outputs 1 if t' = t

Consider П has a deterministic MAC with canonical verification. Then for evey m exists only one MAC_k(m) = t. Adversary can obtain 1 in the experiment only if (m*, t*) gives Vrfy(m*, t*) = 1 and m* was not queried in Oracle or t* != t_queried. Last is impossible, because for every m exists only one t. Thus we get that Pr[MAC_(A,П)(n) = 1] <= negl(n)

# Ex 02

Π = (Gen, Mac, Vrfy)

П' = (Gen', Mac', Vrfy)

- Gen := Gen' (obviously same keys)

- Mac'_k(m) := (t,b), where t:= Mac_m(k) and b - additional bit(s)

- Vrfy'(m, (t,b)) = 1 if t = Mac_k(m) - П secure

BUT! (t,b), where b is additional bit(s), we can find a lof of combinations, that makes the scheme not strongly secure

# Ex 03


Pr[Mac-forgeA,Π(n) = 1] =
Pr[Mac-forgeA,Π(n) = 1] − Pr[Mac-forgeA,Π˜ (n) = 1] + Pr[Mac-forgeA,Π˜ (n) = 1]

S2: Pr[Mac-forgeA,Π˜ (n) = 1]

- Gen' := Gen (key is the same)
- Mac'(m, k) = f_k(m)
- Vrfy'(m,t,k) = Vrfy (m, f_k(m), k)

Instead of F_k(·), we use f_k(·), then Vrfy'(k,m,t) = Vrfy' (k, m, f_k(m)) and Mac'(m, k) = f(m) = t

in this case |Pr[D(f_k(n)) = 1] - Pr[D(r(n)) = 1]| <= negl(n)

so the expression S2, do not change

In this case, CBC-mode enctyption do not show the blocks of the c , like {c0,c1...,cn}. At the end of the process we get one t, and this is the whole tag. Using this information we can not use the same attack as in CBC-mode encryption for ciphertext. That is why CBC-mode for MAC has indistiguishable multiple enctyptions in the presence of eavesdropper.
