(a). So if Vigenere cipher using period t, was used to length t, and when the key is used once.

By Shannon's Theoreme, we have:

|K| = |C| = |M|, than cipher is perfectrly secret(and also that key was used once)

(b). Proof:

if |K| < |M| than there is some m' ∈ M such that m′ !∈ M(c). But then

Pr[M = m' | C = c] = 0 != 1/|M| = Pr[M = m']

# Ex 02

By redefining key space k ∈ {k1,k2,...,k_n} , m ∈ M


For every pair Enc(k,m) = c, Enc is deterministic
Pr[M = m | C = c] = 1/n^2 
Pr[M = m] = 1/n
Pr[C = c] = 1/(n^2)

Pr[C = c | M = m] = 1/n so it was not changed
